# PlasticPushing
This is a analytical/research specific repo for printing various plastics on a voron 3d printing machine

Introduction
I have been 3d printing for almost five years and have only owned two types of printers. a cartisian printer from Creality3D and my custom VoronDesign v2.4. Since I completed the build on the V2.4 I have not stopped printing and want to share my learnings with the rest of the community. 

See links:

FUTURE ADDITIONS:
1) import my base configs, some settings may need to be changed for your printer size/height or other parameters that are specific to you.(Adaptive Speeds based on Andrew Ellis93)

2) (run a temperature tower) you can generate them in SuperSlicer or download and import into your slicer. If there are .3mf files in the repo, you can get them easily imported into your slicer. {WIP .3mf file needs added} NOTE: some people will be using seperate slicing software i.e. cura, simplify3d, ect.. this repo currently does not support those slicers. 

3) (run pressure advance for filament) - See .xlxs file for parameter ranges, EXPERIMENTAL R&D: How nozzle geometries affect print strength/speeds

4) (run Extrusion Multiplier test) - See pre-configured EM .3mf (ABS PROFILE), PLA, PETG, CF filled filaments will come at a later date.

5) OPTIONAL: (run a ADXL board from the Stealthburner toolhead attachment)
