# PlasticPushing
This is a analytical/research specific repo for printing various plastics on a voron 3d printing machine

Introduction
I have been 3d printing for almost five years and have only owned two types of printers. a cartisian printer from Creality3D and my custom VoronDesign v2.4. Since I completed the build on the V2.4 I have not stopped printing and want to share my learnings with the rest of the community. 
Lets talk the basics first, You need to undertand that each printer and your environment will affect everything that is mentioned in this post. Since 3d printing is a skill that takes several hours to understand, all of these settings will have some deviation for your tuning.
Second, since this guide will focus more on tuning each filament manufacturer. Additonally, this is a repository for color palettes so enjoy the splurdge of plastics!
